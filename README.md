**Run your Neo3 nodes for development in record time!**

:fire::fire::fire::fire:

This is the **ultimate** GitHub repository to run your Neo3 blockchain node and start developing. :green_heart:

* :rocket: The code has git sub-modules to the official [neo-node](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules/) and [neo-modules](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-node/) repositories. Then, you can adjust the reference if you want to rely on the latest or an specific commit! :wink:
* :rocket: The Neo3 neo-cli image is built from the official `Dockerfile` from [neo-node](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-node/).
* :star: Includes **all** available plugins from [neo-modules](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-modules/)
* :boom: It just fucking works.

:tada:
